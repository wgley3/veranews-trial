# veranews-trial

Veranews is an experimental site that displays perspectives on various hot-button news issues.

The site collects these issues, but also randomly sorts participants into one of 3 groups:
1. Group A - sees perspectives matching their own ideology
2. Group B - sees perspectives conflicting with their ideology
3. Group C - sees perspectives of both ideologies
